# Virtual SLAM 
This repository is about the project I developed during my robotics studies at LABIRAS, it is a robot that simulates the Roomba 614 vacuum cleaner robot with a lidar sensor, which generates the map of a space and moves around it automatically.
# Technologies used
1. ROS
2. Gazebo
3. SLAM TOOLBOX
4. NAV2
# How can you use this project on your computer
Start the simulation in Gazebo with this command
```bash
ros2 launch roomba_bot launch_sim.launch.py world:=src/roomba_bot/world/world_with_obstacles.world
```
Control the robot with the ros2 control
```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args -r /cmd_vel:=/diff_cont/cmd_vel_unstamped
```
Start map generation with slam toolbox
```bash
ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py slam_params_file:=src/roomba_bot/config/mapper_params_online_async.yaml 
```
Start navigation through the map generated by the toolbox using nav2
```bash
ros2 launch nav2_bringup navigation_launch.py
```
To view the robot in the ROB viewer and define the goal pose it should go to on its own, open rviz
```bash
rviz2
```
